Note that the focus of this homework is not on data collection, but on data analysis and interpretation so do not worry if you did not collect all data in the previous homework.\n",

    "You are going to analyze users. If you selected to create time series of questions take the top 100 users with the most question posts, while if you created time series of answers take the top 100 users with the highest answer scores. For each user, your time series will be the number of questions (for questions), or the score value (for answers) posted by that user at some frequency. You may choose to sample your data each week, each month, on a certain day of the week or at a certain hours in a day depending on what trend you are hoping to find in the data. For example, if you choose to analyze users asking questions and sample during different hours of the day, your hypothesis could be that some users ask more questions during night hours because they are students, while others are more active during day time because they work in industry.   \n",

In a few paragraphs, write down what you were hoping to find in the data (your hypothesis), what timeseries you created, what method you chose and why.
